/**
 * Invoicetronic API
 * The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/

    /**
     * Export invoices as a ZIP archive
     * Export invoices as a ZIP archive of FatturaPA XML files, suitable for import into accounting software (TeamSystem, Zucchetti, etc.).  **Sent invoices** are only included when they have reached a definitive state (e.g., `Consegnato` for private recipients, `AccettatoDalDestinatario`, `DecorrenzaTermini`, etc.). Invoices still being processed by SDI are excluded.  **Received invoices** are always included. Unread invoices are automatically marked as read and counted as operations.  ### Period filters  You can filter by period using either: - `year` + `month` (e.g., `year=2026&month=3` for March 2026) - `year` + `quarter` (e.g., `year=2026&quarter=1` for Q1 Jan-Mar) - `document_date_from` / `document_date_to` for a custom date range  These options are mutually exclusive. The `year` parameter alone is not valid and requires either `month` or `quarter`.  ### Response  Returns `200` with a ZIP archive, or `204 No Content` if no invoices match the given filters. Files in the archive are organized by company VAT number (`{vat}/send/`, `{vat}/receive/`).  ### Rate limiting  This endpoint has a dedicated rate limit: only one export request per user can be processed at a time. Concurrent requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
